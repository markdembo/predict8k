Emerging growth company [  ] If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. [  ] Top of the Form \tItem 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the ""Bank"") obtains most of its funds from the sale of debt securities, known as consolidated obligations, in the capital markets. Consolidated obligations, which consist of bonds and discount notes, are by regulation the joint and several obligations of the eleven Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the ""Finance Agency"") and Finance Agency’s regulations authorize the Finance Agency to require any Federal Home Loan Bank to repay all or a portion of the principal of or interest on consolidated obligations for which another Federal Home Loan Bank is the primary obligor. Consolidated obligations are sold to the public through the Office of Finance using authorized securities dealers. Consolidated obligations are backed only by the financial resources of the eleven Federal Home Loan Banks and are not guaranteed by the United States government. Schedule A sets forth all consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes committed to be issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, for which the Bank is the primary obligor, on the trade dates indicated, other than discount notes with a maturity of one year or less that are issued in the ordinary course of business. Schedule A also includes any consolidated obligations with a remaining maturity in excess of one year, if any, for which we have assumed the primary repayment obligation from another Federal Home Loan Bank. We may elect to change our method of reporting information on the issuance or assumption of consolidated obligations at any time. In reviewing the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, please note: • although consolidated obligations issuance is material to the Bank, we have not made a judgment as to the materiality of any particular consolidated obligation or obligations; • Schedule A does not address any interest-rate exchange agreements (or other derivative instruments) which we may enter into as a result of our asset and liability management strategies and that may be associated, directly or indirectly, with one or more of the reported consolidated obligations; • Schedule A will not enable a reader to track changes in the total consolidated obligations outstanding for which we are the primary obligor because Schedule A generally excludes consolidated obligation discount notes with a maturity of one year or less and does not reflect whether the proceeds from the issuance of the reported consolidated obligations will be used to, among other things, satisfy called or maturing consolidated obligations. We will report the total consolidated obligations outstanding for which we are the primary obligor in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and • the principal amounts reported on Schedule A represent the principal amount of the reported consolidated obligations at par, which may not correspond to the amounts reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles contained in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, because the par amount does not account for, among other things, any discounts, premiums or concessions.  \tItem 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Sorensen, the Company’s Senior Vice President, Operations, in the Andeavor 2018 Incentive Compensation Program (the “2018 Program”). The 2018 Program, as applied to Mr. Sorensen, consists of two components: Andeavor’s overall performance and Business Unit performance. The performance results of Andeavor are modified by the Business Unit results. The performance results of both Andeavor and the Business Unit may be adjusted to take into account unbudgeted business decisions, unusual or non-recurring items and other factors, as approved by Andeavor’s Compensation Committee, to determine the total amount, if any, available under the 2018 Program, and can range from 0% to 200%. The Compensation Committee has discretion to adjust individual awards based on an assessment of each executive officer’s overall performance.Component 1Corporate Performance - Andeavor’s Corporate performance metrics include the following:•EBITDA, weighted at 50% - Achievement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization measured on a margin neutral basis;•Growth, Productivity and Synergies Improvements, weighted at 20% - Targeted improvements from growth initiatives, productivity with existing assets and synergies from acquisitions to create value;•Cost Management, weighted at 15% - Measurement of operating expenditures versus budget;•Process Safety Management, weighted at 5% - Targeted improvement in the number of process safety incidents;•Environmental, weighted at 5% - Targeted improvement in the number of environmental incidents; and•Personal Safety, weighted at 5% - Targeted improvement in the number of recordable personal safety incidents over the average for the past three years.An assessment of each executive officer’s overall performance, taking into account the performance of their respective business units, successful achievement of goals, business plan execution, and other leadership attributes, will be used as the basis for adjusting an executive officer’s payout above or below the amount determined by the overall Corporate Performance.Component 2Business Unit Performance - Measured against target with the range of outcomes between 0% to 200%. Business Unit performance is measured through balanced scorecards with performance metrics including, but not limited to:•Safety and Environmental;•Cost Management;•Improvements in EBITDA; and•Business improvement and value creation initiatives.    Business Unit results for Mr. Sorensen are tied to the Partnership’s performance as well as the performance of all of Andeavor’s logistical assets (other than the Partnership and including logistics assets for which the Partnership may have the right of first refusal). Mr. Sorensen’s total target payout amount is 90% of base salary earnings during 2018.Grant of Awards to Named Executive OfficersOn February 16, 2018, the Committee, acting pursuant to authority delegated by the Board, approved the following grants of awards to the Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers (with Mr. Goff abstaining from voting on his award):Named Executive Officers & TitleTarget Number of Performance-Based Phantom UnitsGregory J.

Sorensen,Senior Vice President, Operations6,476The awards were made according to the terms of the form of performance phantom unit agreement (the “Award Agreement”) pursuant to which performance phantom units may be issued under the Andeavor Logistics LP 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “Plan”), as well as the related 2018 Grant Performance Vesting Phantom Units Summary (the “Phantom Units Summary”). The Award Agreement sets forth the terms of grants for performance phantom units to certain participants under the Plan, including the Partnership’s executive officers. The awards will vest at the end of a performance period ending on February 16, 2021, will be adjusted based on the achievement of relative total unitholder return compared to a peer group of companies, and may range from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance phantom units granted. The Partnership’s peer group may be determined from time to time by the Board or any committee designated by the Board to administer the Plan. Any unvested performance phantom units will be forfeited under certain circumstances regarding termination.Each performance phantom unit granted under the Award Agreement is granted in tandem with an accompanying distribution equivalent right, which entitles the grantee to receive payments in an amount equal to any distributions made by the Partnership with respect to the common units underlying the performance phantom units. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the Award Agreement and Phantom Units Summary which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.(d) Exhibits.*10.1Form of Andeavor Logistics LP 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance Phantom Unit Agreement*10.2Andeavor Logistics LP 2018 Grant of Performance-Vesting Phantom Units and Tandem DERs Term Sheet______________* Filed herewith.SIGNATURESPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.Date: February 23, 2018    ANDEAVOR LOGISTICS LP     By:Tesoro Logistics GP, LLCIts general partner    By:/s/ BLANE W.

HTI modifies monthly distribution to enhance its ability to reposition and grow the portfolio   On February 20, 2018, the board of directors (the “Board”) of Healthcare Trust, Inc. (the “Company” or “HTI”) unanimously authorized a change in the rate at which the Company pays monthly distributions to holders of the Company’s common stock, effective as of March 1, 2018, from $0.0039726027 per share per day, or $1.45 per share on an annualized basis, to $0.0023287671 per share per day, or $0.85 per share on an annualized basis. This represents a change in the annualized distribution yield, based on the original purchase price of $25.00 per share, from 5.8% to 3.4%, or a change from 6.76% to 3.96% based on the Company’s most recent estimated value per share as of December 31, 2016 of $21.45 per share.   The Board modified the Company’s distribution policy to more closely align distributions with current cash flows, to enhance the Company’s ability to execute on the repositioning and growth of the portfolio, and to advance the long-term objective of providing a future liquidity event for shareholders. The updated distribution will begin accruing at $0.85 per share on an annual basis on March 1, 2018, with the first distribution payment made at the new level during the first week of April 2018.   Similar to the experience of other healthcare REITs, performance of skilled nursing facilities and senior housing operating properties have been challenged by changes in reimbursement, increased supply and other factors. Management responded to these challenges in 2017 by repositioning the portfolio by signing leases with new, more credit-worthy tenants and changing tenants and/or managers in 41 properties, including replacing tenants in two skilled nursing portfolios and operators of two seniors housing portfolios.   In making this change to the distribution, the Board performed a thorough analysis of the portfolio and the work management did in 2017 to respond to market challenges. The Company expects these efforts, along with additional acquisitions primarily focused on medical office buildings, to improve property net operating income (NOI), compliance with debt covenants and better align distributions with the Company’s cash flows.   The statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company and members of its management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “seeks,” “strives,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “plans,” “intends,” “should” or similar expressions.
